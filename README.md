# Basic Cpp Setup
This repository contains basic C++ project configuration.
I use it for [BeastEngine](https://github.com/BeastEngine/BeastEngine) development and I wanted to have a basic startup for different C++ projects.

## Content
The basic setup contains CMake and Conan files with a few dependencies.
It also contains development scripts in python which should make development easier.
They can be used to:
 
 - initalize and configure the project (in a very basic way :))
 - build the project
 - add/remove classes and files to targets

 If you are going to use it, please note that it was mostly tailored to my own purposes and may not fit your needs.
 I am planning to add some explanation regarding project configuration. I might also add more scripts to make it easy for everyone to start and create awesome apps faster, without CMake and Conan boilerplate code.
